# General Skill

## Workflow

1. Restate the user goal in one sentence.
2. Inspect relevant files before editing.
3. Apply minimal changes that solve the issue.
4. Run a lightweight verification command when possible.
5. Report changed files and test result.

## Guardrails

- Do not fabricate file contents.
- Keep edits scoped to the user request.
- Prefer deterministic commands and explicit paths.
